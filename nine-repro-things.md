## Reproducible Research Checklist

### Step 1 - Documentation

Document all the procedures for your experiment, trial, survey etc. so that someone outside your project could understand your workings.  Record where results and working data will be saved and save that information where your supervisor or team can access it.  Use a word document or text file.  More details here: How to start Documenting and more by CESSDA ERIC

### Step 2 Naming conventions
Name your files consistently and logically to protect yourself from misplaced or lost data and possible project delays. Establishing a consistent file naming convention from the start will ensure files are easier to find, process, understand, and version control.  A good, basic convention includes standard order, date formats, vocabulary, numbers and punctuation such as these examples:
YYYY-MM-DD_ProjectAbbreviation_FileInformation_Version.filetype  translates to:
2020-01-20_BehChange_Survey1_RawData.xls
2020-01-20_BehChange_Survey1_WorkData_V1.xls

### Step 3 Folder Structure
Create a standard folder structure to keep files organised. Very helpful if sharing files with colleagues. Folders should also follow a logical naming convention.  One simple method is to create folders prefixed by number to reflect your workflow steps. Adding a leading zero for numbers 1-9 will ensure folders appear in the right sequence. Create and store a README.txt file outlining the contents of folders. More here 


### Step 4 Automation
Automate repetitive tasks to eliminate monotony, potential errors, and time that could be better spent on research. Options include using an MS Excel text function, formula or macro, learning to create reusable scripts to repeat data cleaning tasks in OpenRefine, and using Task scheduler for Windows or Automator for MacOS.

### Step 5 Version Control
A version control system allows you and other users to keep track of changes in your Data or Process. Keep master files of all raw data and use only copies of the data for processing. Document versions of analysis software. If you are using random numbers in your research, save your random seed generator number as part of your working data. Use workflow programs and save the workflow as part of your documentation. If you are writing scripts use Git. This way, you can later reproduce your results. More here.

### Step 6 Cloud Backups
Keep a copy of all your data (working, raw and completed) in the cloud.  This ensures that if you suffer a computer failure, lose your laptop, accidently delete or overwrite your data, or if data becomes corrupted, your research is restorable. Griffith has three different types of cloud storage designed especially for research.  Find them here.

### Step 7 Computer Security 
Securing your computer and network means that you are at far less risk of a data breach or hack. Establish good strong passwords and encrypt your computer’s hard drive.  Use a password manager to make the use of strong passwords easy. Found out how to do these here. 

### Step 8 Separating Identified Variables
When protecting privacy of participants, locations or other sensitive information, plan de-identification early as part of your data management planning.    Retain original unedited versions of data for use within the research team and for preservation.  Create a de-identification log of all replacements, aggregations or removals made.  Store the log separately from the de-identified data files.   Identify replacements in text in a meaningful way, e.g. in transcribed interviews indicate replaced text with [brackets] or use XML markup tags. More here

### Step 9 Permanent Identifiers for your Published Results
Once you have completed your project, make your research data discoverable, accessible and possibly re-useable through the use of a persistent identifier such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). A DOI is a unique number which can be assigned to publications, data sets and associated outputs such as grey literature, preprints, workflows, algorithms, software, etc. DOI’s are used for citation, linking with other research, indexing and metrics. Find out how here.
